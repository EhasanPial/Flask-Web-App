                            This is a color fundus photograph of a 35-year-old healthy patient. The media are clear, providing a crisp view of the fundus. The optic disc appears pink with sharp margins and a cup-to-disc ratio of approximately 0.35. The vasculature is normal in course and caliber. The striated sheen radiating outward from the disc is evidence of a healthy retinal nerve fiber layer. There are no lesions, scars, or pigmentary changes in the macula or periphery. The fovea exhibits a crisp foveal light reflex.

                            Cataracts are an eye condition that almost everyone will have as they get older. About half of all adults will have at least one cataract by the time they turn 75.

They occur when the natural lens becomes cloudy, making it harder to see through. The development of cataracts can take years or even decades.

You may not even realize you have cataracts at first since symptoms may be undetectable until your vision worsens. Symptoms include blurry vision, poor night vision, glare, halos, light sensitivity, and trouble distinguishing contrast.

Having diabetes does increase your risk for cataracts, although it’s not the only thing that does. Cataracts can eventually get bad enough to cause blindness, but the good news is that any vision loss from them is fully treatable by undergoing cataract surgery.

It’s still necessary to have regular eye exams to diagnose cataracts as soon as possible, especially if you’re at higher risk due to diabetes or other factors.

                            People with diabetes are twice as likely to develop glaucoma as are non-diabetics, although some current research is beginning to call this into question. Similarly, the likelihood of someone with open-angle glaucoma developing diabetes is higher than that of a person without the eye disease.

                            Neovascular glaucoma, a rare type of glaucoma, is always associated with other abnormalities, diabetes being the most common. In some cases of diabetic retinopathy, blood vessels on the retina are damaged. The retina manufactures new, abnormal blood vessels.
                            
                            Neovascular glaucoma can occur if these new blood vessels grow on the iris (the colored part of the eye), closing off the fluid flow in the eye and raising the eye pressure. Neovascular glaucoma is a difficult disease to treat. One option is laser surgery to reduce abnormal blood vessels on the iris and on the retinal surface. Recent studies have also shown some success with the use of drainage implants.</p>

                            Diabetic retinopathy (die-uh-BET-ik ret-ih-NOP-uh-thee) is a diabetes complication that affects eyes. It's caused by damage to the blood vessels of the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retina).

At first, diabetic retinopathy might cause no symptoms or only mild vision problems. But it can lead to blindness.

The condition can develop in anyone who has type 1 or type 2 diabetes. The longer you have diabetes and the less controlled your blood sugar is, the more likely you are to develop this eye complication.
